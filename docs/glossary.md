**CSV:** Comma Separated Values, .csv, or .CSV files. The simple, plaintext, way of representing a spreadsheet. Each line of the text file represents a row. On each row, columns are separated by a comma, known as a *delimiter*. The first row usually is a header, listing the names of the columns. Sometimes a different *delimiter* is used, such as a tabs, in which case it is known as a TSV.


**TSV:** Tab Separated Values, .tsv, or .TSV files. See **CSV**
