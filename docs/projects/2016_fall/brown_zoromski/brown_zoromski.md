# The Power of the Presidents: How Education and Military Service Affect a Presidency
Daniel Zoromski and Jordan Brown

## The Problem/Question

The Presidents of the United States are a set of individuals who have been widely studied over the years by scholars and hobbyists alike. For this reason, there is no shortage of information, videos, and databases that are full of facts and statistics about these men. Everything from what time of day they were born, what their favorite food was, or who they had affairs with is all available online.

So at first, it may seem ridiculous to do a project on such a widely available set of data. However, this is where we get our initial question. Even though we have a vast ocean of information on the presidents, we have very little research on what connects them to one another. It is these connections that may or may not exist and connect our presidents together that we are interested in looking into. What do these men have in common with one another? Did they become president due to dumb luck and circumstance, or do correlations exist between these men that made them more likely to fall into the position. Asking this question will likely provide more questions the answers, and that is precisely the point.

We predict that some connections will definitely exist between them. That has been evident since we first started the project. The other question then becomes, why do these connections exist and what other questions could they lead to? To show these connections on paper we will take information from pre-existing databases, and plug them into network analysis software like Gephi and Tableau in order to create clear visuals of these connections and a better idea of how strong and numerous the respective connections are. We believe that creating a visuals of these connections will make it easier for us to determine how big of a role certain factors played in making these men presidents.

For our purpose of this project we will be focusing on military service and education. Focusing on these two categories can give us a lot of insight on how these two factors affected the types of presidents they were. Before even collecting the data we began imagining the questions that this project could lead to. Did where they go to school have an effect on their political party? Did presidents who served in the military go to war more or less often during their presidency? Did military service have an effect on where these men went to school, or if they went to school at all. In the end the great thing about this project is the potential to expand on it. This proposal is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to all of the questions our research could lead to.

## Previous Scholarship/Historiography

Scholarship concerning the military service history of the presidents and their foreign policy is relatively easy to find, while scholarship concerning the presidents and their education is scarce. For this reason we chose to more closely examine the scholarship concerning military service history. As the co-founder of the American Diplomacy journal, former academic and Foreign Service Officer Dr. Henry E. Mattox examines the role of the presidency in national conflicts. According to his article U.S. Presidents, the Military, and the Electorate, Mattox states that the power of the presidency has grown extensively over the years since the founding of the United States. 

Specifically, while Congress is designated the authority to declare war the presidency has used the military over three-hundred fifty times for various actions (Mattox 1). The most recognizable conflict that was not officially declared is the use of American force in Vietnam. Mattox also points out that our first commander in chief, George Washington, was a distinguished military commander, and therefore the ideal model of a head of state at the conception of the United States. However, not all presidents have had distinguished military careers, and some did not have any military service at all, as is the case with the current president Barack Obama and president-elect Donald Trump. Is this evidence of changing perceptions regarding the qualifications a president should have? Perhaps, but an investigation into the social, economic, and political cultures and events during the various presidencies must also be done to further any claims. 

Mattox, like us, wanted to focus his research on the possible correlation between military service and the increase in war-making policies by presidents. He began by constructing a table consisting of presidential candidates in past elections with their military service record. 

[Table 2: Mattox](http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/AD_Issues/amdipl_1/milsvc_T2.html)

Mattox found that candidates with military service won twenty-nine of the fifty-two elections from 1789-1992 (Mattox 1). If one includes the five elections since, this number rises by two. In addition, there have only been ten elections (twelve if you count 2012 and 2016) that a major party candidate did not have military service, and seven occurred in the early twentieth century alone (Mattox 1). While the majority of presidents had some military service the extent of this service for several was very limited. Mattox cites Buchanan, Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, Arthur, Lyndon Johnson, and Reagan as the six presidents in question, going into the details of each individual’s military service. Buchanan is also the only president to have military service that did not earn commission as an officer (Mattox 1). It is interesting that three of these presidents served in office consecutively, and that their terms surrounded arguably the most devastating conflict in United States history in the Civil War. 

Ten presidents reached the rank of general before taking over as commander in chief, and only Washington, Grant, and Eisenhower held command of the entire United States Army. Both Grant and Eisenhower, along with Zachary Taylor, were career service members, while figures such as Washington and Andrew Jackson were citizen-soldiers (Mattox 1).

One would think that heroic military service would have a strong connection to being elected to the presidency, but this is not the case. Only six presidents (Washington, W. H. Harrison, Jackson, Taylor, Grant, and Eisenhower) can claim this level of prestige, which is perfectly represented by the Harrison-Tyler campaign slogan “Tippecanoe and Tyler Too!” that recognized Harrison’s military prowess at the Battle of Tippecanoe during the War of 1812 (Mattox 1). Additionally, military service helped jumpstart the political careers of other presidents. For example, the Reconstruction Era Republican presidents all served in the Civil War as high-ranking officers, as a strong military leader was viewed as necessary in order to bring the former Confederate states back into the Union. In addition, Kennedy, Nixon, and Ford all cited their pride for their service in the Navy during World War II while running for congressional office early in their political careers (Mattox 1).

Another note that Mattox makes is the fact that each of the major conflicts in United States history, barring Vietnam, have led to the rise of one or more presidents. This is not at all surprising due to the fact that just over half of the elections (including 1996-2016) have produced presidents with military service. Additionally, it raises a question about the perception of candidates with military service at different points in history. For example, from the end of World War I to the end of World War II there was only one presidential candidate, Wendell Willkie (who lost to Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940), that had military service, and this correlates with the anti-interventionist sentiment that occurred during this time period in the United States (Mattox 2).

The election of 1940 was also the first election after the start of World War II in Europe, so it was not surprising that at least one candidate had previous military service. This is the one time that a prominent military figure that served in a previous war did not come into office shortly after the respective war’s conclusion (Mattox 2). As stated earlier, the Civil War produced a total of seven presidents, six that were generals and one major (McKinley), that took office following the war’s end in near subsequent fashion. In addition, the presidency would be occupied by nine consecutive individuals with military service records following World War II, from Truman to George H. W. Bush, with all but Truman and Carter serving during World War II (Mattox 2). The departure from a president with military service in 1992 with Clinton, as well as in 2008 and 2016 with Obama and Trump, perhaps represents a shift in perception that the commander in chief must have previous military service. On the other hand, there are most likely a host of additional factors that led to the election of these individuals. 

One final note from Mattox is the fact that even with all of the individuals elected with a military service record, and the rise in presidential military authority, the United States has avoided a military takeover of the government. Mattox cites several scenarios when a takeover seemed likely due to the conditions, whether it be war or economic collapse, facing the nation. The most glaring possibility was the election of 1864 during the Civil War that pitted Union general George McClellan against the incumbent Lincoln, as McClellan and the Democrats represented a movement towards peace (Mattox 2). However, General Sherman’s “March to the Sea” campaign during the fall and winter of 1864 all but secured a Union victory in the war, thus renewing confidence in Lincoln’s ability to lead. 

Dr. Christopher J. Deering, a political science professor at George Washington University, also raises awareness of the rise in the military power that the presidency holds despite the Constitution’s checks. The founders wanted to avoid the consolidation of power into one branch, particularly the executive, in order to avoid tyranny. Despite this, the size of the military establishment under the presidency’s command has increased greatly since George Washington took office in 1789 (Deering 138). This raises an interesting question: does previous military service really correlate to more military action as president, or does the ever growing presidential military authority, regardless of the individual in office, mean that military action is inevitable? For example, Obama did not have a military service record but military interventions across the Middle East and Africa, particularly in Iraq, Libya, Somalia and Syria, originated or continued under his presidency. The size of the military under the original framework of the constitution was supposed to be limited except in times of war, however, the increase in presidential military authority over the last two centuries (especially following World War II) has allowed presidents to form a large standing military, thus allowing them access to forces should they desire to use them. As stated above, Congress has not formally declared war since World War II, which means the use of force since has been authorized in roundabout ways. Deering concludes that Congress will remain at a disadvantage regarding the checks on presidential military authority because the means rest firmly in the executive branch, which makes the past military service of a president even more interesting to study (Deering 147).

## Workflow

Gathering the data necessary run the network analysis tool was actually quite simple. As previously stated, the amount of data that is available on the United States presidents is numerous. We therefore had to find an existing database and transfer that data into an Excel spreadsheet. From there, we separated and organized each president in the order that they served. Once we had the presidents in the correct order we added the following categories: Name, birth year, birth state, death state, education, military service, and political party. At that point all of the necessary data was organized on our spreadsheets and ready to go. In order to make the most simple and easy to interpret visuals we decided it was best to create two separate spreadsheets, one focusing on education, and the other on military service. Once we had the spreadsheets broken down by those two categories we were ready to use the network analysis software.

### Gephi

When we got the idea for the project the first thing that came to mind in terms of creating a visual was Gephi. Using Gephi we would be able to take the connections that we knew were there and could see on paper and create an entire network with it. This would mean that anyone looking at it would be able to have a clear idea of what categories linked these presidents. Possible connections include two presidents attending the same university, or two president both serving in the army and part of the same political party. The possibilities went on and on. However, one of the biggest problems with gephi was the difficulty in creating a separate nodes and edges spreadsheet, and subsequently converting it into a format that Gephi could actually understand and produce a network with. As a result, the visuals we got on Gephi did not yield any significant results, and the visual would consistently mess up or gray out certain areas because it had trouble reading our spreadsheets.

### Tableau

Using Tableau was not really part of our original plan when the concept of this project was coming into fruition. It was really the difficulty we had using Gephi that drove us towards the idea of trying Tableau. In the end this may have proven to be a blessing in disguise. Tableau is actually much easier to use, and a lot more flexible with what can be done with it. As previously stated, we realized pretty early on in the process that this project will lead to more questions than answers. The reason that this is so interesting is the questions that this process will lead to are questions that have possibly never been asked. By using Tableau to sort these certain categories we were able to create an organized database of connections, which we could later dig deeper into and attempt to answer the questions it leads to.

## Initial Impressions 

Some examples of interesting findings are that presidents with military service became Republicans almost 2-1, and that was especially true for high ranking officers such as generals. Is this a coincidence, or is there more to it?

![Military Service by Political Party](\Images\MilitaryServicebyPoliticalParty.jpg)

![Military Rank by Political Party](\Images\MilitaryRankbyPoliticalParty.jpg)

We were not able to find anything interesting regarding the presidents and their education other than the fact that the majority of presidents that did not graduate from a higher institution were Democrats. Harvard produced as many Democrats as Republicans, and Yale produced only two more Republicans than Democrats. For this reason, we will narrow our focus to military service and rank for future projects.

![Education by Political Party](\Images\EducationbyPoliticalParty.jpg)

It is important to keep in mind that the sample size of data we had to work with was too small to confirm anything significant without further investigation. When all was said and done, the results led to more questions as we had initially expected, most of which we would have never even thought to ask before making a visual of what connects these men. However, we have a good foundation for asking questions such as do members of the military become Republicans more often, and if so, why? The great thing about these questions is the fact that they can apply to more than just presidents. Take education for example, Do people with better educations more often vote and/or become Democrats, and if so, why? It is easy to see that this can lead to a rabbit hole that just keeps going deeper and deeper until you get to a point where the research is not even about the presidents, and that is part of the reason we found this idea to be so interesting. 

Just focusing on military service and education allowed us to notice some interesting connections and correlations between factors like military service and political parties, as well as education and political parties. Finding these connections will then allow us to ask (possibly in a future class) why these connections exist. Is there something there, or is it just coincidence? In other words, this project gave us a great starting point because it produced usable results, and helped give us an idea of where to start as well as what questions to ask in the future. What were the main issues of the time; what was a certain president’s rhetoric towards an issue; what kind of promises did they make? If we dig more with questions like these in mind we can pick part speeches, letters, and diary entries, and see if there is a connection between the main issues they focused on and their rhetoric, as well as how that correlates with their political party. For example, we would love to examine Eisenhower’s rhetoric towards conflicts in his speeches because he was a career service man with a decorated record. We discovered the Miller Center at the University of Virginia, which has an online database for the presidents with everything from their speeches to administrations, at the end of our project. We would like to use text analysis tools such as Overview and Voyant in order to analyze the rhetoric towards war and other conflicts of figures that stand out in our data, Eisenhower included. We would also like to use Topic Modeling in order to group certain presidents by key words that they use to describe war and conflicts, hopefully leading to more questions and answers.

It would be naive to think that connections do not exist in other aspects of these individuals’ lives. Even things that seem trivial and unimportant such as the state they were born in, the state they died in, and what they died of can uncover some interesting information and lead to more questions that no one would have ever thought to ask. Overall, the main theme of this project has been asking questions we never would have even considered asking before learning about these small connections. From here we want to dig deeper into the connections between military service and how it affects which parties these men ended up in. As mentioned earlier in the introduction, the amount of data we have on the presidents is enormous, and covers literally every aspect of these men's lives. Since the information is already out there our job becomes categorizing the data to suit our needs and searching for connections that can lead to further questions, as well as answers the questions that brought us here in the first place.
