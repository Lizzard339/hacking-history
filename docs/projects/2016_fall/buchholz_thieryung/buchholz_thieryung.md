“Politics is like sausage being made.  It is unsavory, and it always has been that way, but if everybody’s watching, you know, all of the backroom discussions and the deals … then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So you need both a public and a private position.”
           ... Hillary Clinton

## Question

The description of our political process, as stated above, is indeed one that makes people nervous.  Americans suspected, or one could say they even knew, that the things that go on behind the closed doors of Washington D.C. were underhanded, duplicitous, and undemocratic.  The Wikileaks email explosion of the 2016 Presidential Election removed all suspicion.  A bright spotlight was placed on the inner working of the Democratic National Committee, the Clinton Foundation, the Clinton Department of State, and the Clinton Presidential Campaign.  The media, no doubt, put many journalists and computer scientists to the task combing through the volumes of leaked emails.  They discovered many things, but what more can be learned?  By employing different strategies, more information can be obtained.  Combining, comparing, and contrasting the three separate databases will yield more information about the ‘sausage making process’ we call democracy. 

Would it be possible to create connections between people by using an email server as the data source?  By using the Clinton/Podesta/DNC emails from Wikileaks could you figure out any connections between the two sets of data? Could you combine the two sets of data into one larger community of emails would it true change the email connections that much?  How could this new view impact how we look at the Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton? 

## Historiography
A growing number of researchers in digital humanities are using computational methods for the analysis of large cultural data sets.  Social network analysis is the process of exploring social structures with network and graph theories.  It characterizes networked structures in terms of nodes, or individuals, and edges, or relationships, which connect them.  Early sociologists, Simmel and Durkheim, noted the importance of studying the patterns that connect people in social situations or social networks.  Overtime this study has evolved into studying the way people relate in units of all sizes from family groups to international groups.
Studying these social networks can reveal previously unknown ties and relationships one can only see through a macroscopic lens.  History and Humanities researchers, in the past, focused on the individual.  The development of Digital Humanities, along with the development of Big History, has widened the scope of what is possible for researchers.  We can know look at vast quantities of data and, with the use of new technology, we are able to ask new and very different questions.  

These new methods are now being applied to not only historical data, but also to the volumes of information we are exposed to everyday.  The emergence of Wikileaks, and similar whistle-blowers sites, has given the average person access to a huge amount of information.  The problem this poses is that it is too much information.  One person could not possible read and digest this amount of information before it becomes irrelevant.  The answer to this quandary exists in the methods used by the Digital Humanities field.  Using web scraping, network analysis, and visualization software, these massive data dumps can be collected, cleaned, analyzed, and visualized in a way that makes understanding their contents possible for the average person.

The MIT Media Lab, established in 1985, has done extensive work on the three Clinton related archives related tot his project.  They publically share their work and allow access to media outlets and others.  Their project distills massive volumes of data into manageable and understandable visualizations.  When asked why they created this tool:
>“At the MIT Media Lab Macro Connections group, we build tools to transform data into stories. ClintonCircle was not created to visualize these emails, but it is a fork of a tool called Immersion that we launched in 2013 and that helps people visualize and understand the networks they weave through email interactions.
Some of the other tools we have built include the Observatory of Economic Complexity, which is the world’s leading site visualizing international trade data, Pantheon, a project exploring our species collective memory, and DataUSA, the most comprehensive visualization of US Public Data. We build all of these tools to improve people’s ability to understand and explore data, and to democratize the benefits of data exploration and visualization.”
     

America has just concluded the most contentious election season in recent memory.  The Clinton and Trump campaigns spent a staggering $2.1 billion dollars to influence America’s choice for the top position in the U.S. government.  Did they get their monies worth? 

In this election season, it can be argued that the Internet, and its free flow of information, influenced the outcome of the election more than the massive amount of money spent by either campaign. Information available, at no cost, to millions of voters via the Internet changed the results of the slam-dunk predicted by the pundits, the polls, and the think tanks for Hillary Clinton.  Wikileaks published tens of thousands of emails revealing the inner workings of the Clinton State Department, Clinton Foundation, and Clinton Campaign.  Many argue that the source of the emails is illegitimate or Russian backed.  These claims may be true, but you cannot unring the bell. 

Since the results of the U.S. Presidential election were announced, media focus has been on how Donald Trump won, rather than how Hillary lost. In the days after the election, some have concluded Bernie Sanders would have been a better candidate. Voter turnout on both sides was lower than in the past two Presidential elections.  Many polls projected that white women, and African Americans would turn out in droves to support Clinton.  They also predicted that the Latino vote would turnout for Clinton in protest of Trump’s immigration policies.  None of these predictions materialized.  Why?

Much of the voter disillusionment in Hillary Clinton, in hindsight, can be linked to her terrible favorability and trustworthy ratings. In the era of the informed voter, whistle blowers, and Internet – Clinton was a toxic candidate.  The media, the political elite, and the pundits all marveled audibly at Hillary’s defeat, some even cried on national television.  How did they miss all the signs?  Many on left who supported Sanders, and many on the right who never liked the Clinton’s, were shouting from the rooftops – but no one was listening.

Regular Americans, on the right or the left, have a very unfavorable view of Washington, D.C.  We listen to politicians tell us they are on our side, we send them to D.C., and nothing gets done.  It seems as though, in 2016, change was on the minds of Americans across all political parties.  Donald Trump, a true outsider, managed to get the GOP nominations.  Bernie Sanders, one can argue, was the Democrat’s outsider.  He received immense grassroots support, but was denied his day at the polls by the DNC.  

Here are just a few things we learned, so far, from Wikileaks that influenced Clinton’s trustworthy ratings, which ultimately cost her the election:

1. Debbie Wasserman Shultz, DNC Chair, and the party undercut Sanders and his supporters at every turn.  This exposed the inherent unfairness of the system that Clinton was so much a part of and cost Wasserman Shultz her job. 
2. Wikileaks also exposed Wasserman Shultz’s replacement, Interim DNC Chair Donna Brazile.  Brazile was giving Clinton the questions, in advance, for Town Hall Debates in which she was debating Sanders.  She obtained these questions through her affiliation with CNN.
3. Hillary Clinton was the first person under FBI investigation to run for President.  Wikileaks hacked and released the emails from Clinton’s illegal private email server that was discovered during a Congressional Investigation into the Benghazi incident. 
4. The DNC and Podesta Wikileaks showed the public that the White House, who was backing Clinton, was aware of the private server because President Obama directly emailed Clinton on it using a pseudonym. 
5. The John Podesta emails, according to some Sanders supports, shined a light on the real face of the shadow government – the mega rich and the corporations.  Podesta has multiple firms listed in the Panama Papers and is a major donor and a lobbyist.  Podesta’s former sister-in-law owns a major law firm and is a mega donor and bundler to Hillary Clinton. His brother, Tony Podesta, is another major contributor and one of the biggest lobbyist in D.C.
6. Another leaked email suggests that Clinton, unlike any other Democratic Canidate wanted to use the Simpson-Bowles Blueprint to cut Social Security. 
7. The hacked emails also contain transcripts of Clinton’s speeches to foreign businesses and governments.  She said many unflattering, and some would call Anti-American things during those paid speeches.  
8. Wikileaks also brought under scrutiny the Clinton Foundation.  It showed that they accepted money from foreign donors and governments and used Foundation money for personal enrichment, travel, and even Chelsea Clinton’s wedding.


## Main Data Source – Wikileaks
https://wikileaks.org/What-is-Wikileaks.html
Wikileaks Statement of Purpose:
“WikiLeaks is a multi-national media organization and associated library, founded by its publisher Julian Assange in 2006. WikiLeaks specializes in the analysis and publication of large datasets of censored or otherwise restricted official materials involving war, spying, and corruption. It has so far published more than 10 million documents and associated analyses.
WikiLeaks has contractual relationships and secure communications paths to more than 100 major media organizations from around the world. This gives WikiLeaks sources negotiating power, impact, and technical protections that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to achieve.
Although no organization can hope to have a perfect record forever, thus far WikiLeaks has a perfect in document authentication and resistance to all censorship attempts.”

Data Sources from Wikileaks databases:
### Hillary Clinton Email Archive
https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/
March 16, 2016
WikiLeaks launched a searchable archive for over 30 thousand emails and email attachments sent to and from Hillary Clinton's private email server while she was Secretary of State. The 50,547 pages of documents span from June 30, 2010 to August 12, 2014.  Approximately 7,570 of the documents were sent by Hillary Clinton. The emails were made available in the form of thousands of PDFs by the U.S. State Department as a result of a Freedom of Information Act request.

### The Podesta Emails
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/
WikiLeaks series on deals involving Hillary Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta. Mr Podesta is a long-term associate of the Clintons and was President Bill Clinton's Chief of Staff from 1998 until 2001. Mr Podesta also owns the Podesta Group with his brother Tony, a major lobbying firm and is the Chair of the Center for American Progress (CAP), a Washington DC-based think tank.

### DNC Email Database

https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/
Starting on Friday 22 July 2016 at 10:30am EDT, WikiLeaks released over 2 publications 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments from the top of the US Democratic National Committee -- part one of our new Hillary Leaks series. The leaks come from the accounts of seven key figures in the DNC:  
Communications Director Luis Miranda (10520 emails), National Finance Director Jordon Kaplan (3799 emails), Finance Chief of Staff Scott Comer (3095 emails), Finance Director of Data & Strategic Initiatives Daniel Parrish (1742 emails), Finance Director Allen Zachary (1611 emails), Senior Advisor Andrew Wright (938 emails) and Northern California Finance Director Robert (Erik) Stowe (751 emails).
The emails cover the period from January 2015 until May 25, 2016.
The Podesta Emails
https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/
WikiLeaks series on deals involving Hillary Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta. Mr Podesta is a long-term associate of the Clintons and was President Bill Clinton's Chief of Staff from 1998 until 2001. Mr Podesta also owns the Podesta Group with his brother Tony, a major lobbying firm and is the Chair of the Center for American Progress (CAP), a Washington DC-based think tank.


## Workflow
The main workflow of this project follows the following path of work:
 
1. Obtain the data source from the Internet, which is found at https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/ and https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/ and https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/.

2.  Use the program webscraper.io to get this data from these websites. The idea of webscraper is to mass download large data sources from the internet with little effort. Webscraper will turn the data set that you just downloaded into a .csv file that would be labeled however you have labeled it.
3.  Clean the data scraped with webscraper. This can be accomplished by using a simple script provided at the end of this section. The purpose of cleaning the data allows the use other programs that could be later used for analysis on the data. Cleaning a .csv file removes the end line breaks that would be found in .html so it would be readable inside excel without the program changing what would be shown on the .csv file.

Many questions can start to be solved by using the program Gephi. By using this program you will be able to make connections and relationships between where and from the emails were sent. By looking at the community that is developed through algorithms and how frequent people would send emails to others. With these communities, you can analyze the traffic patterns and understand the connections that the data provides from the emails.

### Script
```python
import csv
DATA_FILE = "clinton_emails.csv"
CLEAN_FILE = "clinton_emails_clean.csv"
FIELD_NAMES = ["from", "to_who", "text", "subject", ""]
def readfile(filename):
	raw_data = []
	with open(filename, mode='r') as csvfile:
   	csv_reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
   	for row in csv_reader:
       	raw_data.append(row)
	return raw_data
def writecsv(filename, filedata):
	with open(filename, mode='w', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
   	csv_writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=FIELD_NAMES)
   	csv_writer.writeheader()
   	for row in filedata:
       	try:
           	csv_writer.writerow(row)
       	except:
           	print(FIELD_NAMES)
           	print(row.keys())
def writetxt(filename, filedata):
	with open(filename, mode='w', encoding='utf-8') as txtfile:
   	for line in filedata:
       	txtfile.write(line)
data = readfile(DATA_FILE)
for row in data:
	row["text"] = row["text"].replace("\n", "")
writecsv(CLEAN_FILE, data)
counter = 0
for row in data:
	counter += 1
	writetxt(str(counter) + ".txt", row['text'])
```

## Initial Conclusions:

To enlighten Americans on why Hillary lost the general election, it is worth pointing out that Clinton may not have even won the Democratic Primary had it not been for the highest extent of scale-tipping the party has seen in recent memory. Had the Democratic National Committee given Sanders a fair chance, Democrats might have won the White House.  Wikileaks has not yet given us a ‘smoking gun’ but it has taken us behind the scenes as the sausage was being made, and Americans do not like what they have seen.  It is showing us that, unlike the kindly old grandpa figure of Sanders, Clinton is a tightly controlled, careful, methodical politician. Her aides script her jokes, tweets, and her ad-libs.  She is shown to be someone who is willing to compromise and to have public and private positions.

This project proposes a further investigation of these email archives to determine what relevant information exists that has yet to uncovered.  The datasets and workflow information are offered here to encourage the public to make use of them.
