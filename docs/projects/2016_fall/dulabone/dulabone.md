# Effects of Economic Changes During the American Civil War on the U.S. Confederacy 


## The "Question"
How did the economy of the United States Confederacy change over the course of the American Civil War and why? A study of the information can be used to figure out things such as: 

  - The quality of life for people in the Confederacy: 
     1. What was the quality of life for people in the South before, during, and after the American Civil War? 
     2. As a result of economic changes, did the quality of life suffer because of negative change, or did     it remain relatively the same?
     3. What were the differences between quality of life for plantation owners and people who did not own slaves?
  - The items traded:
    1. What items increased or decreased in trade?
    2. Why did some items increase or decrease over others?
    3. What were the supplies and demands for the items of the Confederacy to export or import?
  - International and domestic trade
    1. How did changes in trade affect prices of items traded internationally or domestically? 
    2. Where some items harder to trade than others because of negative relations? For example, one country supporting the Union and not the Confederacy.
    3. Did any international demand for the Confederacy's goods decrease, thus causing countries to look toward other countries to trade with?
    4. How did naval blockades affect trade?
  - Production:
    1. Was there more or less production of any goods? 
    2. Did a smaller workforce due to men having to fight in the war have a role in any decreased production of goods?
    3. Are any of the questions mentioned above a result of decreased wages?
    4. Was the production of any particular good not affected due to the use of continued slave labor over paid labor?
    5. Was there an increase in the use of slave or indentured labor used in lieu of paid labor?
  - Did this seem to have any long lasting effect on the economy?
     1. Did wages stablize? Continue to decrease, increase, or stay the same?
     2. Did the price of goods return to pre-war value or did they continue to fluctuate not relative to expected inflation?
     3. How large of an impact did inflation have?
  
This information could also be used to recognize patterns of trade or general economic changes for any country caught in a war relative to their own time period and goods. Or, one might find that patterns might not exist at all and the economic changes brought upon the Confederacy during the American Civil War is completely unique and different from any other war.

## Scholarship
As documentation on almost every aspect of the American Civil War is outstanding, much has been written and synthesized about this topic in particular. Numerous scholarship has been written about trade and its affects during the American Civil War including the recording of satistical figures. As a result, I did not need to do much to find information on this topic. 

One article on this topic, "Money, Prices, and Wages in the Confederacy, 1861-65" by Eugene M. Lerner, contains the information obtained by Cambridge University Press that I used for a data set. In this article, Lerner discusses the U.S Confederacy's stock holdings, prices, and wages and how and why each changed during the American Civil War. This is just one study that has a plethora of usable information recorded in graphs, tables, and charts.

What seems to be missing from this topic is the use of digital scholarship to tie all of the pieces together. I found while researching, what seems to happen more often than not is that the information regarding this topic is simply, just there. We have plenty of the pieces, but not much has been compared back to each of the topics at hand; they exist separately from each other. A reason as to why this might be is that very few seem to be interested in this topic. Indeed, this topic may be outdated or unappealing to most, especially when considering the many more "interesting" topics that one can study about the American Civil War. If anything, it has become unfortunately common that the information that one gains about the American Civil War stays at the high school level or has become romanticized for modern culture for authors to use as subject materials for fictional (or "based on true events") novels, plays, and movies. 

I did find at least two uses of digital scholarship pertaining to, or that could be used to supplement this topic, in that of Andrew J. Torget's Texas Slavery Project and Robert K. Nelson's Mining the Dispatch. In the Texas Slavery Project, Torget reviewed pre-Civil War Texas tax records to show the expansion of slavery and movements of people. In terms of my project, Torget's project could be repeated for all of the Confederate States and used to determine population growth and whether or not the amount of people within the Confederacy slowed or expedited trade with a new and possibly larger work force. 

In the greater scheme of things, in terms of the study of the American Civil War, Torget's project could be added to the works of those contributing to the Mapping Texts data collaberation between Stanford University and the University of North Texas. As of now, the Mapping Texts collaberation has data sets and visualization that show language patterns, use of words in newspapers, and quality of newspapers. In addition, all of this information is public and shared by and made accessible by the scholars working on the Mapping Texts collaberation through GitHub.

Another form of digital scholarship I found was through Mining the Dispatch created by Robert K. Nelson. Like the Texas Slavery Project, Mining the Dispatch is also broad and discusses multiple aspects of the American Civil War. In regards to this topic, Nelson has included in his work, a section on economy, specifically trade. In this section, Nelson provides an interactive graph with articles to supplement the specific year in which we are viewing the trade items. I included this as a data set as well, because it could be beneficial to the overall theme of the project.

Overall, as for my proposed project itself, it is possible to use the data collected to recognize changes in economies in general, not just the economy of the Confederate States of America soley during the American Civil War. In addition, there is no reason why the same questions could not be used to evaluate changes in the economies of other countries, during war or times of normalcy. Indeed, if one looks beyond the frame of this proposed project which focuses on the Confederacy during the American Civil War, they would find that it could be quite versatile.

## Workflow
Data on this topic was not difficult to find because a large quantity of scholarship already has been written on the topic or recorded through logs.  Here are just some data sets that could be used for this project.
  
-Data Sets: 
1. >a. To find the data for the first, I had to be logged into the University of South Floridas's library server. Here, I searched for databases. My favorite database to find information on my subject was the Cambridge University Press’s “Historical Statistics of the United States” database.

    >b.  From here I searched the indexes. I searched "C" and "Co" for Confederacy 
    [![Hist.png](https://s17.postimg.org/z8j4hsdin/Hist.png)](https://postimg.org/image/78f0xia23/)

    >c. After this, I scrolled to find "Confederate States of America". Opening this link lead me to     articles and PDFs regarding the US Confederacy
    [![hist3.png](https://s22.postimg.org/p75icr5k1/hist3.png)](https://postimg.org/image/4a9a837j1/)

    >d. From here, I chose "Prices and wage indexes for the Eastern Confederacy: 1861–1865" ( Not        pictured above)

    >e. Clicking on this link provided me with data already extracted from the article, a table, as     well as the original source. 

    >f. I attempted to go the original source and scrape data myself, but was unsuccessful. Luckily      for me, this website provide me with a downloadable Excel file. In hindsight, it was unnecessary     to attempt this because the website has already provided the data set. 

    >g. With this data set, I went to Open Refine to clean the data. Although it did not need much           cleaning, and this could have been done on Excel because it was not a large or complicated           file, I removed the column regarding skilled labor wages versus unskilled labor wages as I           felt it was superfluous to the task at hand.
    [![hist5.png](https://s23.postimg.org/c3rrvpax7/hist5.png)](https://postimg.org/image/4nsi9wn7r/) [![hist6.png](https://s17.postimg.org/mfbwhx6db/hist6.png)](https://postimg.org/image/e9tujri4b/)

    >h. Finally, I attempted to make a nice graph comparing prices and wages to each year recorded,      but failed miserably. Personally, I am not skilled at using and separating data in order to          visualize anything of use.
    
2. >a. A good piece of data that could also be used for this project is the Mining the Dispatch's        trade graph since it has already been graciously made by Robet K. Nelson as discussed earlier.
    [![hist4.png](https://s23.postimg.org/whz9omdgr/hist4.png)](https://postimg.org/image/b8bndrx5z/     )
   
     >b. I came across the Mining the Dispatch website after reviewing an article regarding digital      scholarship related to this topic.
   
    >c. Once again, I tried to scrape this for my own purposes, but failed to do so successfully,       thus, never even reaching an attempt to visualize my own interpretations of the data.
    
For the future, both of these data sets would be beneficial in understanding the topic. If I had to attempt to scrape these data sets, I would collaborate with someone more adept at understanding how to webscrape properly and form useful visualizations.


## Initial Impressions:

Initially, I expected to find never-ending information on the topic of the economy of the United States Confederacy. My expectations were met, being able to find plenty of usable data in the forms of individually crafted graphs, tables, and even just text alone. I do not have any visualization that I would like to have created for this project. This is simply due to the fact that I had trouble scraping data and/or putting informtion from charts, tables, or graphs together how I would want them. In fact, I deeply considered and tried inserting graphs made form Microsoft Excel's "Insert Chart" function just to have something visual. Once I attemtped to make a chart and realized that the information that I had wanted to compare from multiple graphs to show changes did not match up correctly, I decided against this because I felt it was juvenile and innapropriate for the task at hand. Perhaps someone more adept and talented at data visualization will be able to take data regarding this topic and create usable visualizations.

Due to my being unsuccessful in actually doing anything truly useful with any data that I found, I do not have any evidence-supported answers to my proposed questions. What I do know are my hypotheses regarding some of  my questions, mostly based on my preexisting knowledge of the topic, and simple common sense. For instance, I believe that evidence will support that:
- Quality of life suffered for both slave owners and non slave owners as a result of  economic changes during the American Civil War.
- Changes in prices made it harder to trade with other countries, and, as a result, other countries sought out other alternatives to import goods.
- Blockades negatively affected trade.
- There was less production of goods as a result of decreased demand, possibly due to restraints and the physical inability to move said goods.

Undoubtedly, much more work needs to be added to this project than what I have been able to provide. If I were to execute this project, I would prefer to work in a team so that the images I envision can translate to a visual representation for everyone to see.
