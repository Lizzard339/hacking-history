## Week 7

### Everyone

No universal assignments this week.

### DH I
1. Read the textbook, *Exploring Big Historical Data*, Chapter 4, pp 73-111.
2. Download [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/). There is no installer, so just stick the file wherever you want to put it. This is one of the most powerful data-cleaning tools out there, and it is totally open-source!
3. Work through this [tutorial on OpenRefine](http://schoolofdata.org/handbook/recipes/cleaning-data-with-refine/), and come to class ready to try it out.
4. **UPDATE** In the tutorial above, the link to the dataset is broken. [I've uploaded a copy here.](../files/provincial-and-district-hospitals.csv)

### DH II

1. Read [Data Curation and the Digital Humanities](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-3/data-curation-as-publishing-for-the-digital-humanities/).

### Grad Students

1. Read [Data Curation and the Digital Humanities](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-3/
2. data-curation-as-publishing-for-the-digital-humanities/).

## Week 8

### Everyone

Continue OpenRefine assignment from the previous week.

---

## Week 9

### Everyone

We will discuss an essential reading... the textbook, *Exploring Big Historical Data*, Chapter 5, pp. 159-194, "Making Your Data Legible: A Basic Introduction to Visualizations." Students who have taken DHI should re-read/skim the chapter.

### DH I (Undergraduates and Graduates)

[Download and register Tableau Academic](http://www.tableau.com/academic), using your USF email. You will be able to use the software immediately as a two-week trial. Tableau will contact you with your free license before your trial expires.

Complete the introductory Tableau tutorial at [UCLA's Intro to Digital Humanities](http://dh101.humanities.ucla.edu/?page_id=163). However, instead of saving to the web, as the tutorial has you do in the last portion, export the dashboard as an image. To do this, click 'Dashboard' menu, and then choose 'Export Image' and then save it to your computer. Finally, upload the visualization you created in the tutorial to Canvas.

**NOTE:** Your visualization may look different than the one shown on the website, that is ok.

### DH I Graduate Students

Start reading (you do not have to finish by this week) [Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html).

### DH II

When re-reading the Chapter 5 (see above), reflect on your own experiences last semester when trying to put together visualizations for your project. Did any of the issues mentioned in the chapter spring up in the course of your work? How did it affect your project, what decisions did you make in response? Come prepared to discuss what works (and what doesn't) this week.
